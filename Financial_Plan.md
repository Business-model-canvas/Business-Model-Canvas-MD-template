- For the servers we used AWS TCO Calculator https://awstcocalculator.com/#</br>
- Database Server: 1 server - 256GB memory - 4 processors - 6 cores - DB - Linux OS - SQL Server Enterprise (BYOL) - 3 sets of storage capacity 1000TB each - SSD (Doubled in size for year 2)</br>
- Website Server: 1 server - 256GB memory - 4 processors - 6 cores - NON DB - Linux OS - 1 sets of storage capacity 1000TB each - SSD (Doubled in size for year 2)</br>

- Building lease - For 1000 employees we will need at least 200sqft per employee as well as space for servers and common areas. Assuming 250k sqft will be enough space @ $20.00/sqft/year which appears to be the higher end average for omaha area https://www.loopnet.com/search/retail-space/omaha-ne/for-lease/</br>
- Utilities - according to altenergymag.com the avg cost of utilites per sqft is $2.10 https://www.altenergymag.com/article/2019/07/what-is-the-average-utility-cost-per-square-foot-of-commercial-property/31382</br>

- CEO Salaries were obtained from Glassdoor searches</br>

- For the Customers, our first customer would be Walmart who has 2,200,000 employees and the revenue is based on charging Walmart $1.00/employee.</br> 
- Year 2 assumes we get Amazon as a second customer who has 840,400 employees</br>
- year 3 adds Boeing and Delta who are 145,00 and 80,000 employees respectively</br>
