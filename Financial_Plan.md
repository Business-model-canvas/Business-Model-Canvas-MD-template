- For the servers we used AWS TCO Calculator https://awstcocalculator.com/#</br>
- Database Server: 1 server - 256GB memory - 4 processors - 6 cores - DB - Linux OS - SQL Server Enterprise (BYOL) - 3 sets of storage capacity 1000TB each - SSD (Doubled in size for year 2)</br>
- Website Server: 1 server - 256GB memory - 4 processors - 6 cores - NON DB - Linux OS - 1 sets of storage capacity 1000TB each - SSD (Doubled in size for year 2)</br>
- Office Server: 1 server - 256GB memory - 4 processors - 6 cores - NON DB - Linux OS - 1 sets of storage capacity 1000TB each - SSD (Doubled in size for year 2)</br>
- Customer Service Server - 1 server - 256GB memory - 4 processors - 6 cores - NON DB - Linux OS - 1 sets of storage capacity 1000TB each - SSD (Doubled in size for year 2)</br>
- Payroll - $25.00/hour for a 40hr work week</br>
- Health Insurance - numbers based off $14,400 with the employee paying $4,400 annually https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/benefits/pages/employers-adjust-health-benefits-for-2019.aspx#:~:text=The%20total%20cost%20of%20health,up%20from%20%2414%2C099%20this%20year.</br>
- Building lease - For 1000 employees we will need at least 200sqft per employee as well as space for servers and common areas. Assuming 250k sqft will be enough space @ $20.00/sqft/year which appears to be the higher end average for omaha area https://www.loopnet.com/search/retail-space/omaha-ne/for-lease/. It makes more sense to lease a bigger building from the beginning to house our prospective employees than have to move locations multiple times to house increasing employees.</br>
- Utilities - according to altenergymag.com the avg cost of utilites per sqft is $2.10 https://www.altenergymag.com/article/2019/07/what-is-the-average-utility-cost-per-square-foot-of-commercial-property/31382</br>
- Office Furniture & Electronics - According to David Cummings the average per person cost of office furnitures is about $1500.00 and average cost of electronics is $2000.00 https://davidcummings.org/2011/03/07/costs-to-furnish-a-nice-startup-office/#:~:text=Here%20are%20ballpark%20costs%20to,nice%20cubicles%20are%20%243%2C500%2Fperson)</br>
- Digital Training Record creation is based off an inflated estimate from isitwp.com claiming "feature-rich, cutom-built websites can go as high as $30,000 or more" https://www.isitwp.com/how-much-does-it-cost-to-build-a-website-expert-answer/#:~:text=Depending%20on%20your%20needs%2C%20building,domain%20name%20and%20web%20hosting.</br>
- CEO Salaries were obtained from Glassdoor searches</br>

- For the Customers, our first customer would be Walmart who has 2,200,000 employees and the revenue is based on charging Walmart $1.00/employee.</br> 
- Year 2 assumes we get Amazon as a second customer who has 840,400 employees</br>
- Year 3 adds Boeing and Delta who have 145,00 and 80,000 employees respectively</br>

- Based on the total profit this business is financially viable given we could get the start-up funds and there is a lot of room for error and unknown expenditures in the profit margin.
