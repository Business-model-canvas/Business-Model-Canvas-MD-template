# Value Propositions
* Market we're trying to corner is the inbetween/disgruntled users of Reddit/4Chan/Tumblr and open a multi-country and political bias free discussion board. <br>
* Contrary to most other forum based sites, we are trying to have a more balanced ratio of women to men, as women make up of vast majority off "influencer" demographic leading to more traffic.
* In terms of online forum, we think specifially it will be a discussion board to post images, videos, ideas, questions, discussions and be able to stream content to their audiences. Unlike other forum based sites we will allow members to monetize their content. This will fill the niche gap of being the bridge between more discussion based sites such as Reddit, and the streaming and live interactions of platforms such as Twitch, with the social appeal of Instagram.
