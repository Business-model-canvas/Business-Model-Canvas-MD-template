# Key Partners
- Cloud email provider: We will provide Microsoft Office 365 Premium to our employees, which, will enable our them to send, receive, accept and store email from customers and/or end users. We feel that using one service provider over two will cut down on issues with systems attetmpting to communicate with each other. 
- Banks: Intially, we will apply for a SBA 7(a) loan from "Chase" bank to get our company started. Additionally, we will use "Capital One" for our business savings, checking and credit card accounts. Merchant services accounts allow us to accept credit and debit card transactions from our customers. As our Merchant service account provider we will use Flagship Merchant Services. We also work with banks to provide loans to our customers if needed.
- Advertising: We will advertise through Google advertising and use Concentrix's award winning Marketing Solutions Department to design advertisement campaigns to spread the word about our products and services, attract target customers, and generate sales.
- Data storage partners: Innovieren requires storage systems that are highly scalable, offer unlimited connectivity, and support multiple platforms. Additionally, we will be handling sensitive information and feel that owning our own storage equipment is preferred as opposed to outsourcing our data storage needs.  
- IT remote support providers: We will also use Concentrix's Multi-lingual Customer Engagement Service. This partner would help our company take care of on-line customer services and tiered technical support during out-of-office hours.
