# Key Partners
<p>One Piece will partner with Spotify or other music streaming services and that would allow us to have music play on our live streams.<p>
  They would push ads for our website on the non-premium spotify accounts, and we would have a giveaway of premium membership for a year during initial wave of customer sign-ups.

  <p>Amazon: Strike deal with Amazon to utilize cloud services for website hosting/data storage for free. In return, put their advertisement on our homepage, and highest trafficked page.
