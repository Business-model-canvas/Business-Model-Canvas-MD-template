# Key Partners
<p>One Piece will partner with Spotify which would allow us to have music play on our live streams and royalty free music attached to boards (if creators prefer).<p>
  Spotify would push ads for our website on their non-premium accounts, and we would have a giveaway of premium membership for first year during initial wave of customer sign-ups.
  <br>
  <p>Strike deal with Amazon to utilize cloud services for website hosting, data storage, backup storage,and SQL services for free. In return, their advertisements are put on our homepage, and highest trafficked page. After first initial 6 months of sign-ups, start charging them for advertisements on all pages, but at a reduced rate for mainpage and highest trafficked page.
<br>
    <p>Partnership with Amazon will also allow us to incorporate their algorithms for targeted advertisement based on customer likes, views, etc. With targeted advertisement popping up, One Piece will generate revenue based on views, clicks, and with re-directs from our sites to Amazon's products, a percentage cut of the overall sales made.
