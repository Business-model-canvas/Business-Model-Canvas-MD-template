# Key Partners
<p>One Piece will partner with Spotify or other music streaming services and that would allow us to have music play on our live streams.<p>
  They would push ads for our website on the non-premium spotify accounts, and we would have a giveaway of premium membership for a year during initial wave of customer sign-ups.
  <br>
  <p>Strike deal with Amazon to utilize cloud services for website hosting/data storage for free. In return, put their advertisement on our homepage, and highest trafficked page. After first initial few months of sign-ups, start charging them for advertisements on our page, but at reduced rate in comaprison to other companies for slots.
<br>
    <p>Partnership with Amazon will also allow us to incorporate their algorithms for targeted advertisement based on customer likes, views, etc. With targeted advertisement popping up, we'll generate revenue based on views, clicks, and with re-directs from our sites to Amazon's products, a percentage cut of the overall sale made.
