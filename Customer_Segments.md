# Customer Segments
* Demographic - 18-35 age range, 
  * 75% Male/ 25% Female, (Numbers based on a collection of online forums with similar utilization) 
  * In terms of online forum, we think specifially it will be a discussion board to post images, videos, ideas, questions, discussions and be able to stream content to their audiences. Unlike other forum based sites we will allow members to monetize their content. This will be fill the niche gap of being the bridge of the gap between more discussion based site such as Reddit, the streaming and live interaction of platforms such as Twitch, and the social appeal of Instagram.
  * We hope that within the first year we could 500-1000 daily posters, and 5000 daily users. Hopefully those numbers will at least double anually within the follwoing years.
 * Geographically: Due to it being a universal topic board, open to most countries in the world with translation option. 
 * Needs: Open forum, corner the market on areas that facilitates free discussion. Potentially opening for areas of the world more restrictive on speech. Allow area for political agenda freedom (no bias). 
 * Economic: Free to all users, while allowing subscriptions to remove ad space and allow for seemless browsing and give tiered emojis and animations. 
 * Education: Appealing to people with some college education to college educated people.<br>

# Development over Time: 
* Production of an automated moderator team based on artificial intelligence input from moderator team monitored over the beginning startup period (first inital 2-4 years). [Cut Costs overtime][Potentially market AI to other boards depending on success?]// Overtime, push for cleaner scripts and coding to allow for more seemless and quicker transition from pages to posts/comments/images. <br>
