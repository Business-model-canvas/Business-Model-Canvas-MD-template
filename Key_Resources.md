# Key Resources

We would require team to run the website and manage the financial resources. We would need a marketing team to help publicize ourselves. In terms of actual starting capital - we do not need many resources as office space/overhead is not much. Teleworking could be possible to minimize costs in certain components. We would need a building to house the server racks, servers, and servercomputer.<br> 
<br>Starting off as a small start up we would need not much as us 5 partners will be most of the brains/muscle of the organization. With forecasted growth, layout for division of teams will commense. <br>
<br>The first team would be a data management team to make sure our servers are running well. We would also need a software engineering team to push any updates to our site. We would also need a finance team to ensure that we are managing our accounts and balances correctly. Then finally I think as the original founders can in some form beccome the PR team/boaard of directors. <br>
<br>In terms of physical resources we would grow from being able to host the site remotely to having dedicated servers and an office space to work in. <br>
